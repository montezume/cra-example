# Contacts App
### Create, edit, view and delete contacts.

This app is made to be a simple showcase of the a single page application using React (bootstrapped with create-react-app), Redux and React Router. I added styled-components and material-ui to make the styling a bit easier. Axios is used for api calls, and redux thunk as async dispatch.

In order to run this application locally, clone this repository and then run yarn (or npm install), and then yarn start
Then clone the repository for the "api" [link-to-api](https://github.com/montezume/cra-example-api).

Again, yarn and run start for the api.

Open browser to localhost:3000.

Or else, you can check it out on heroku below.

The heroku branch has a working link: [heroku-link](https://salty-temple-54752.herokuapp.com/)

Cheers,
