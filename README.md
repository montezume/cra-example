# Contacts App
## Create, edit, view and delete contacts.

This app is made with a simple showcase of the a single page application made using React (bootstrapped with create-react-app), Redux and React Router. styled-components and material-ui made
the styling a bit easier.

In order to run this application locally, clone this repository and then run yarn (or npm install), and then yarn start
Then clone the repository for the "api" [link-to-api](https://github.com/montezume/cra-example-api).

Again, yarn and run start for the api.

Open browser to localhost:3000.

Or else, you can check it out on heroku below.

The heroku branch has a working link: [heroku-link](https://salty-temple-54752.herokuapp.com/)

Cheers,
